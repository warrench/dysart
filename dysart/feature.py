"""
Top-level DySART feature class. Defines dependency-solving behavior at a high
level of abstraction, deferring implementation of update conditions to user-
defined subclasses.

The Feature interface is designed to be as nearly invisible as possible. The
rationale goes like this: someone---somewhere, somewhen---has to explicitly
specify the device-property dependency graph. This person (the "user") should be
protected only from thinking about more than one system layer _at a time_.
Later on, some other scientist might like to take a far-downstream measurement
without having to think about _anything_ more than the highest layer defined by
the last person who touched the system.
